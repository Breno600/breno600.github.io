## Hello Everyone!

Hi, I'm **Breno Xavier**.<br>
I'm currently working as an Architect, Devops and Developing the best architecture and implementation, organizing teams, automating tasks and creating the entire infrastructure in the aws cloud. I love to solve problems about clouds and others resources.<br>
if you want know about me check my [resume].

## Understand the processe
When you understand that need do, you make the best choice about the solution.<br>
Create a **decision matrix** about different situations and you start understand when you use a resource or a solution.<br>  

## Don’t repeat some task

Think how you can improve your efficiency.

## Try a new process
Sometimes a new process might be best solution, when you understand what you need do.<br>
You can’t expect to become more productive unless you pay a price at first.
