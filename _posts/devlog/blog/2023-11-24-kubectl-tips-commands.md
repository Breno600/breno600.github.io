Recently, I got a [question] asking about the functionality to make image pop up so viewer can have
a better look at it. I'm not sure what is the common name of the functionality (*popup image? image gallery?*),
but I happens to have thought about the same feature long time ago, but never started
implementation. So I thought this would be the good time to start it!<br>
~~And it took whole friday night because I didn't know that `element.src` and
`element.getAttribute(src)` returns different thing~~
